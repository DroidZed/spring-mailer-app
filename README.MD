##Spring Mailer App

This app is my open source implementation of an SMTP server using Spring Boot and GraphQL.

Feel free to fork the project and use it as you like, the credentials for the app are currently stored in a `.env` file for security reasons.

Everything is ready to go.

You can run it with :

```shell
.\mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or, deploy it on the cloud (ex: Heroku)
